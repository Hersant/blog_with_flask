# Overview
This repository provides code for developing a simple blog using [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) framework and SQLite. Bootstrap is also used to make the blog more attractive.

The goal here is not to develop a complete blog but to show how Flask can be used to easily develop an application. Thus, the tasks that a user could perform are : 
- list articles
- click on the title of an article to view details
- add, modify and delete an article.

# Prerequites
You should have Python 3 and [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/) installed.


## 
> mkdir project_repo

> cd project_repo

- Create a Python virtual environment (in the project repo), then activate it :
	- python3 -m venv venv
	- . venv/bin/activate
Once the virtual environment is activated, your CLI should have the prefix '(venv)'.

- Install Flask : pip install flask
